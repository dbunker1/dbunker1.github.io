Interests: Data analysis, Machine Learning, Development

Project Idea: 
	Branching off of the interactive recipe pages topic, I will create a website that will offer a new random recipe for each continent, each day.
	The interactivity will take place with a option to change servings for a recipe and the ability to generate a random recipe based on user preferences.
	I would use the database to store recipes and user data.
